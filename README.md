## About Me

I am a passionate researcher currently working at CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, India. My primary focus is on identifying novel small molecule inhibitors for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). I am dedicated to leveraging advanced ML/DL to make a meaningful impact in the field of drug discovery  research of breast cancer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on identifying novel therapeutic agents for TNBC.
- ðŸŒ± Learning new advanced bioinformatics tools and techniques and ML/DL frameworks.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to bioinformatics and AI-based drug discovery program.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love cooking and  exploring (virtual) culture of different countries in my free time.

## Featured Projects

### [Drug Discovery Pipeline](link-to-project)

## PhD first project work:
The iDCNNPred project aims to develop an interpretable deep learning model for identifying potential inhibitors of the PI3KÎ± isoform, a critical target for treating triple-negative breast cancer. By leveraging 2D molecular images and employing Bayesian optimization, the study builds and evaluates Custom-DCNN models alongside fine-tuned pre-trained models like AlexNet, SqueezeNet, and VGG19. The best-performing models are used to screen the Maybridge chemical library, identifying 12 promising hit molecules, of which 4 are validated through in-vitro studies. The project enhances model transparency using Grad-CAM visualizations, providing a robust framework for discovering new PI3KÎ± inhibitors and advancing cancer therapeutics.

<!-- ## PhD second project work:
As part of my PhD second project work, I developed advanced graph neural network (GNN) models to screen potential hit molecules against the AKT target in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) disease. This project involved building with different split-types and different attentive and non-attentive GNN classification models to identify molecules with better binding affinity and biological activity. Through this research, we successfully identified few novel potent molecules that show promising results in biological assays.

#### Key Contributions:
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Utilized GNNs to represent molecular structures effectively.
- **Attentive and Non-Attentive Models**: Build  attentive and non-attentive GNN models to understand their strengths and weaknesses.
- **Novel Molecule Discovery**: Identified few novel molecules with superior binding affinity and biological activity against the AKT target.
- **Biological Validation**: Conducted biological assays to validate the efficacy of the identified molecules.

**Note**: This project is currently unpublished.

## PhD third project work:

In my PhD third project, I developed advanced graph neural network (GNN) models to screen a chemical library and identify potential hit molecules targeting p70S6K in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). This project involved creating various split-types and both attentive and non-attentive GNN classification models to pinpoint molecules with enhanced binding affinity and biological activity. Through this research, we successfully identified several novel p70S6K inhibitors that demonstrated promising results in biological assays.

#### Key Contributions:
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Leveraged GNNs to effectively represent molecular structures.
- **Attentive and Non-Attentive Models**: Constructed and compared attentive and non-attentive GNN models to assess their respective strengths and weaknesses.
- **Novel Molecule Discovery**: Identified several novel molecules with superior binding affinity and biological activity against the p70S6K target.
- **Biological Validation**: Performed biological assays to validate the efficacy of the identified molecules. -->
